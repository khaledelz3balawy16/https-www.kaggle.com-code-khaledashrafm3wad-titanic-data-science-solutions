Titanic Data Analysis Overview

The Titanic dataset provides valuable information about passenger survival, influenced by various factors such as age, passenger class, and gender. The original notebook by Manav Sehgal employed a method where missing age values were imputed based on the passenger's class (e.g., 1st class, 2nd class, etc.). This approach, while useful, might not fully capture the nuanced age distribution associated with specific passenger titles like "Mr," "Mrs," and "Master."

In my updated notebook, I refined the imputation process by using passenger titles to estimate missing age values. This method reflects more accurate age distributions tied to titles, such as "Mr" for adult males or "Master" for young boys, leading to more precise age imputation.

Additionally, while the original analysis relied solely on training scores to evaluate the model's performance, I extended the evaluation to include test scores. This dual approach helps prevent misleading conclusions and ensures a more comprehensive assessment of the model's effectiveness.

To further enhance understanding, I visualized the relationships between each feature and the target variable. These visualizations provide clear insights into how features like age, class, and gender influence survival rates, making it easier to interpret the data and model results.

Summary

Khaled Ashrafâ€™s modifications introduce a more accurate method for age imputation and a thorough evaluation process, along with visual tools to clarify feature-target relationships. These enhancements improve the overall analysis of the Titanic dataset.
